# Introduction

"VR/AR for Biomedical Image Analysis and Clinical Neurosciences" is a tutorial for the 2023 International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

In this tutorial, we introduce and showcase recent, highly interesting applications of **virtual-reality (VR)** and **augmented-reality (AR)** for **biomedical image analysis and clinical neurosciences**. In recent years, there has been a vast interest in VR/AR and biomedical image analysis. We hope to bring together VR/AR and biomedical and clinical applications to meet the growing interest across communities.

Our exciting program will cover the following topics of interest with VR/AR:

* Life Sciences Image Analysis
* Cerebrovascular Image Analysis
* Clinical Neurosciences and Practices
* Clinical Anatomy Teaching

We look forward to seeing you on **Oct 2nd 2023 2pm-6pm @ Paris convention center**!

## Live Hands-on Sessions

We will feature live hands-on sessions for the participants!

We will demonstrate the VR/AR projects from the invited speakers in action!
**More than an hour of the program will be dedicated to the participants trying out the devices live!**
Participants are also encouraged to bring their own data and their own scenarios for VR/AR and we can explore together.
