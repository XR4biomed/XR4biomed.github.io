# Introduction

"VR/AR for Biomedical Image Analysis and Clinical Neurosciences" is a tutorial for the 2023 International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

In this tutorial, we introduce and showcase recent, highly interesting applications of virtual-reality (VR) and augmented-reality (AR) for biomedical image analysis and clinical neurosciences. In recent years, there has been a vast interest in VR/AR and biomedical image analysis. We hope to bring together VR/AR and biomedical and clinical applications to meet the growing interest across communities.

Our exciting program covers the following topics of interest with VR/AR:

* Life Sciences Image Analysis
* Cerebrovascular Image Analysis
* Clinical Neurosciences and Practices
* Clinical Anatomy Teaching

# Live Hands-on Sessions

We will also feature live hands-on sessions for the participants!
We will demonstrate the VR/AR projects from the invited speakers in action,
and dedicate more than an hour of the program for the participants to try out the devices live.
Participants are also encouraged to bring their own data and their own scenarios for VR/AR and we can explore together.
